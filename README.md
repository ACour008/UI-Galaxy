# UI-Galaxy
An implementation of GUI for a procedurally-generated galaxy

###About
This project procedurally-generates approx. 1400-1500 Stars (depending on screen size), which producedurally generate their own solar system -- planets, moons, and jump gates. The gui layout I have created for the galaxy lists a Star's properties and celestial bodies when a user clicks on one of them.

Screenshots available soon.
