# UI-Galaxy
A UI Map for a procedurally-generated galaxy

### About
This procedural generation system creates approx. 1400-1500 stars within 3 seconds -- depending on screen size & computational power -- which recursively generates their own solar system. Each solar system may be comprised of planets, moons, and jump gates (the connections between star systems). The UI map I have created for the galaxy lists a Star's physical properties (star classification, temperature, radius, etc) and its celestial bodies when a user clicks on one of them.

Screenshots available soon.
